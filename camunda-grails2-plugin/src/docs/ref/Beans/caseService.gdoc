h2. Bean 'caseService'

You can use the *[org.camunda.bpm.engine.CaseService|http://docs.camunda.org/latest/api-references/javadoc/org/camunda/bpm/engine/CaseService.html]* as an injectable bean:

{code}
def caseService
{code}

The plugin registers the bean as 'camundaCaseServiceBean' with the default alias 'caseService'.
You can change this default alias via [configuration|guide:bean-names].

{note}
The caseService is just available from camunda BPM version 7.2.0 onwards.
