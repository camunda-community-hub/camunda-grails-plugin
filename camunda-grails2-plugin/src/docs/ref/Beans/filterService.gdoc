h2. Bean 'filterService'

You can use the *[org.camunda.bpm.engine.FilterService|http://docs.camunda.org/latest/api-references/javadoc/org/camunda/bpm/engine/FilterService.html]* as an injectable bean:

{code}
def filterService
{code}

The plugin registers the bean as 'camundaFilterServiceBean' with the default alias 'filterService'.
You can change this default alias via [configuration|guide:bean-names].

{note}
The filterService is just available from camunda BPM version 7.2.0 onwards.
